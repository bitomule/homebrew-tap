  # Nothing runs reap on its own, and the pool's health depends on
  # it: with deliberately does not shut simulators down on exit, so
  # on a machine with no schedule the only cleanup that happens is
  # whatever someone types. Measured before this existed: seven pool
  # simulators still booted with no holder, four idle for 25 to 46
  # hours, 24 GB of swap against 18 GB of RAM, disk at 0.1 GB free.
  #
  # --scrub 120 empties a slot's generated caches, logs and
  # temporary files once it has been cold for two hours, keeping
  # the simulator itself. Measured at 1.3-1.9GB per slot. Safe to
  # schedule precisely because it destroys nothing a slot cannot
  # regenerate, which is what separates it from --purge.
  #
  # Shipped as a Homebrew service rather than a plist simpool writes
  # itself: installing something that starts on login is the user's
  # decision, made explicitly with "brew services start simpool",
  # never a side effect of installing a binary.
